        The Country Park has a large, well equipped play area with a medieval
        city – 8m tall, railway-themed play equipment, large sandpit area,
        plus the usual swings, slides and roundabouts.<br><br>The play
        area is a very popular facility and was refurbished in 2014 and will
        be again in 2023. We asked parents and kids what they wanted to see -
        which is why it's such a hit.
