/*
As an assignment, I proposed a joint interest in developing this website by Friends of Ruscliffe Country, Ruscliffe Borough Cancil and facilities businesses to attract more customers.

There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Just functionally correct joint content from Ruscliffe Borough Council Ruscliffe Country Park with new web page design. By applying familiar web structure including standard navigation will be easy for visitors to find relevant information.
